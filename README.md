## Controller Management

### Overview
The DoomBox uses a DualShock 4 controller with advanced pairing and connection management. The system supports both Bluetooth and wired connections with automatic reconnection.

### Quick Controller Setup
```bash
# Scan for controllers
./scripts/controller-manager.sh scan

# Pair a specific controller
./scripts/controller-manager.sh pair MAC_ADDRESS

# Auto-connect to saved controller
./scripts/controller-manager.sh auto-connect

# Check controller status
./scripts/controller-manager.sh status

# Test controller input
./scripts/controller-manager.sh test
```

### Controller Features
- **Konami Code Support**: ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA triggers test mode
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatically connects to paired controllers on startup
- **Multiple pairing methods**: 5 different approaches for difficult-to-pair controllers
- **Bluetooth stack reset**: Automatically resets Bluetooth when needed
- **MAC address detection**: Recognizes DualShock 4 controllers by hardware signatures

### Troubleshooting Controllers
1. **Controller not found during scan**:
   - Ensure controller is in pairing mode (hold PS + Share for 3-5 seconds)
   - Controller light should flash white
   - Try resetting controller (small button on back)

2. **Controller found but won't pair**:
   - Run `./scripts/controller-manager.sh setup` to install dependencies
   - Try different pairing methods (script tries multiple approaches automatically)
   - Check Bluetooth service: `systemctl status bluetooth`

3. **Controller disconnects frequently**:
   - Check battery level
   - Ensure controller is "trusted": the pairing script handles this automatically
   - Try wired connection for debugging

### Supported Controllers
- DualShock 4 (all variants)
- Sony Interactive Entertainment Wireless Controller
- Compatible with MAC prefixes: 00:1B:DC, A0:AB:51, 00:26:43, 20:50:E7, 00:1E:3D
