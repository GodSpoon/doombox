Project Outline: Radxa Zero QR-to-Doom Gaming Kiosk
1. Project Overview
Objective:
Develop an interactive kiosk application for the Radxa Zero single-board computer that displays a QR code, collects user information via a web form, verifies Instagram follow, launches Doom with the user's name, tracks high scores, and awards a prize to the top player.

2. System Architecture
